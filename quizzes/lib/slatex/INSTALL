Installation instructions for SLaTeX

-

1) Ensure you have the scmxlate program installed on
your system.  scmxlate is available at
http://www.ccs.neu.edu/~dorai/scmxlate/scmxlate.html

1) Unpack the slatex tarball, creating a directory
called slatex 

2) Edit the file scmxlate-slatex-src.scm as
suggested in the comments there.  

3) Invoke your Scheme (or Common Lisp) listener and load
the file scmxlate/scmxlate.scm, using its correct relative
or full pathname.

(load ".../scmxlate/scmxlate.scm")

This will configure SLaTeX for your Scheme/CL dialect
and operating system, creating an appropriate
slatex.scm file.  A script file (called slatex.bat on
Windows and just slatex on Unix) is also created for
convenient invocation on your operating system command
line.  You may need to check slatex[.bat] to see
that it has correct pathnames. 

4) Copy or move or link slatex.scm into the location
you identified in scmxlate-slatex-src.scm.  

6) Copy or move or link slatex.sty into a suitable
place, e.g., somewhere in your TEXINPUT(S) path.  For
installing on system, place in directory containing
the LaTeX style files. 

7) (If your platform is a Mac, ignore this.)  Copy or move
or link the shellscript slatex or batfile slatex.bat to a
suitable place in your PATH, e.g., your bin or the system
bin.  

8) Run slatex on slatxdoc.tex for documentation.
(This also checks that slatex does indeed work on your
machine.)  Refer to slatxdoc.dvi when befuddled.

9) If a shellscript/batfile slatex[.bat] cannot
be meaningfully used on your system, you can use the
file callsla.scm, which is also created by the
configuration process.  Load callsla.scm into your
Scheme/CL and call the procedure call-slatex with your
document filename as argument.
