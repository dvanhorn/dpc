Updated scmxlate confign.

2.4z2

Nov 1, 2002

Dialect `plt' creates slatex module (as opposed to
dialect `mzscheme', which just creates a file of
definitions).  (John Clements)

For `plt' module to work, setf macro shouldn't rely on
slatex-error at expansion-time.  (John Clements)

slatex.sty message modification to allow for
version disparity between slatex.sty (TeX code) and
slatex.scm (Scheme code).   (John Clements)

2.4z1

Oct 31, 2002

Replaced define-macro by define-syntax

Oct 28, 2002

Added missing \enableslatex in slatxdoc.tex

Modernize configuration to be more in line 
with my other programs (tex2page, etc).

Port to scsh, sxm.  petite == chez.

2.4y3

Mar 2, 2002

Use \CR instead of \cr in \m@ketabbox defn because it
appears to somehow (how?) clash with LaTeX's
{tabular}.  Based on bug report by Greg Sullivan
showing that {schemebox} inside a {tabular} was
erroring.

2.4y2

Dec 24, 2001

Make full SLaTeX doc online-browsable.

Dec 23, 2001

Accept MzScheme v200 (in addition to previous
versions).

Nov 10, 2001

\+ in slatex.sty clashing with url.sty.  Reported by 
Francois-Rene Rideau.  Corrected by changing \+ to
\tabalignaux.

2.4y1

Feb 19, 2001

\ZZZZinput definition fixed so that 
reasonable redefinitions of \input won't
cause it to fail.  

2.4y

Dec 23, 2000

Opening string " at the very end of a line caused
problems.  Problem reported by Matthias Felleisen
(PLT bug number 1802)

2.4x

Feb 19, 2000

{schemetopbox}, like {schemebox} but aligns
them using their tops.  Code added by
John Brinckerhoff Clements and Robby Findler.

2.4w

9 Oct 1999

Read cr before lf when reading files on Windows (Shriram report) 

Token delimitation strengthened (John Clements bug
report).

CL set-dispatch-macro-character arg should be uppercase
character because CLISP doesn't automatically upcase
it as standard suggests

2.4v

8 Mar 1999

Comma'd forms inside backquote should get the right font
assignment even if preceded by quote.  (Shriram bug report)

2.4u

15 Jan 1999

Use require-library instead of reference-library.

pathproc.scm: *path-separator*, *directory-mark*,
*file-hider* have approp values for OS = Windows.

MzScheme/Win95 slatex.bat should contain Windows-style
line termination.

Config file for CLISP on Win 95.

Jun 8, 1998

2.4t

distribution mishap fix

May 1, 1998

2.4s

Port to STk

Apr 21, 1998

2.4r

Port to Allegro Common Lisp for Linux.  Minor config
bugs nixed.

Apr 1998

2.4q

Ports to Windows 95, Gambit, MIT Scheme.

Apr 1997

2.4 p

{schemeregion} should not collapse lines with TeX comments
into one (nor should it eat the comment character).

v. 2.4o

Fixed indentation bug caused by implicit space after \\
in tab environment.

Feb 1997
v. 2.4n

Fixed bug that caused \begin{schemebox} to produce space at
paragraph begin (Matthias Felleisen).

Ported to Bigloo, thanks to Christian Queinnec.

* typesets as \ast.  (* "as is" is too high.)

Ported to Guile.

May 1996
v 2.4m

Ported to MzScheme.

Check that config.dat has right number of answers.
Eliminates common typos while setting up config.dat
(Shriram's sugg.).

Accommodate Schemes that allow loading of files mentioned on
the command-line, but using an option such as -load or -f
(Shriram's sugg).

Changed names in preproc.scm to avoid collision with
existing Scheme procs, if any.  (Shriram Krishnamurthi's
idea.)

Ported to GCL (Linux).
Changes to package system -- uses CL's package sys in CL.
dump-display made more efficient.
Cleaned up bat config.

Feb 1996
v 2.4l

Ported to Macintosh Common Lisp.

Version number reported on invocation and whilst loading
slatex.sty (to enable trenchant bug reporting).

No longer requires "system" procedure spec from user via
config.dat.  Other config info should be sufficient to
deduce this.  One less confusion.

v 2.4k

-- and --- in Scheme tokens are treated as minuses rather
than en- and em-dash.  Mike Ernst's idea.

v 2.4j

Now recognizes :keywords as data in CL.

Left margin error in indented {schemedisplay}s corrected

Package system made more robust

Apr 1995
v 2.4
Support for OS/2, both FAT and HPFS.

Included sample Rexx script (for OS/2 + emTeX + scm)
that has robust TEXINPUT recognition.

Fixed paragraph indentation bug after {schemedisplay}
within {schemeregion}.

Recognizes LaTeX2e files in addition to LaTeX2.09.

Sentence-ending space doesn't follow null?, set!, etc.

Documentation converted to plain TeX.

Added {schemeresponse}, {schemeresponsebox}, and their
corresponding \defscheme*token and \undefscheme*token.

Fixed bug related to quoted special symbols;
quoted math escapes; and quoted strings.

Added \setdata in analogy with \setkeyword,
\setvariable, and \setconstant.
\schemeresult, etc., distinguish between constant and
data -- data items are set in \datafont; everything
else in \constantfont.

Removed bogus \ignorespaces from \slatexdisable.

Typeset code is now frenchspaced (instead of using
\null's) to avoid sentence-ending spaces after ! and ?.
Mark Krentel's idea.

Added config code for Matthias Blume's VSCM.

Jan 1994
