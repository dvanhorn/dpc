I've made a mess! I wrote a couple different classes with similar behavior and
then relied on the common behaviors in writing some client code, but I failed to
put an appropriate interface between them.

Define an interface to document the contract between my classes and my client.

\begin{schemedisplay}
  ; A Bread is a (new bread\% Number Number Number)
  (define-class bread%
    (fields Kcal mass density)

    ; \scheme{-> Boolean}
    ; Is this bread fresh?
    (define/public (fresh?)
      ...)

    ; \scheme{Soup -> Bread}
    ; Construct a new bread that has been dipped in soup
    (define/public (dip-in-soup soup)
      ...))

  ; A Burrito is a (new burrito\% Number Number)
  (define-class burrito%
    (fields mass length)

    ; \scheme{-> Boolean}
    ; Is this burrito fresh?
    (define/public (fresh?)
      ...)

    ; \scheme{-> Number}
    ; The total Kcal contained in this burrito
    (define/public (Kcal)
      ...)

    ; \scheme{-> Mess}
    ; Unwrap this burrito into its fillings
    (define/public (unwrap)
      ...))

  ; \scheme{nutrition : Food -> Number}
  ; The nutritional value (in Kcal) of the input food
  (define (nutrition x)
    (if (send x fresh?)
      (send x Kcal)
      0))
\end{schemedisplay}
