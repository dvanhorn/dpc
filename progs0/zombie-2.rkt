;; Play the classic game of Zombie Attack!

;; All zombies move toward the player.  The player moves 
;; toward the mouse. Zombies collision cause flesh heaps 
;; that are deadly to other zombies and the player.  
;; Randomly teleport via mouse click as a last resort!

;; Based on Robot!, p. 234 of Barski's Land of Lisp.
