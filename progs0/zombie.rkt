;; Comments:

;; Built-in lists are fair game for this problem.

;; General Guidelines:

;; If someone repeatedly makes the same mistake, eg:
;;   Self Complex -> Complex
;; instead of
;;   Complex -> Complex
;; treat it like they did this on only half of the problems.
;; So if Self Complex -> Complex is worth 1 out of 2 contract
;; points, you'd get 9+9/2 (= 13.5 ~ 14) points for contracts
;; on methods.

;; Style points are up to the grader's discretion, but should
;; follow the style guidelines on the web page.

;; (Let us know if you have further guidelines we should add.)

;; ==========================================================
;; Play the classic game of Zombie Attack!

;; All zombies move toward the player.  The player moves 
;; toward the mouse. Zombies collision cause flesh heaps 
;; that are deadly to other zombies and the player.  
;; Randomly teleport via mouse click as a last resort!

;; Based on Robot!, p. 234 of Barski's Land of Lisp.
