@title[#:tag "soln03"]{1/26: Zombie, redux}

This is a solution for the @seclink["assign03"]{Zombie, redux}
assignment that was due on 1/26.

@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
  @item{@bold{Zombie!}

This is a re-design of our @seclink["soln02"]{original
solution} to the Zombie game.  It's not necessarily better or worse,
just a different design for diversity.
