@defmodulelang[class/0]

The @racket[class/0] language is the most basic version of the class
system.  In essence, it extends @secref[#:doc '(lib
"scribblings/htdp-langs/htdp-langs.scrbl")]{intermediate-lam} with the
ability to define classes, construct objects that are instances of
classes, and to send such objects messages to call methods.

@defform[(require module-name ...)]{
Imports all the modules named @racket[module-name]s.}

@defform/subs[#:literals (fields define)
	      (define-class class-name 
                 field-names
		 method-or-test ...)
	      ([field-names code:blank
                            (fields field-name ...)]
               [method-or-test method test]
	       [method (define (method-name variable ...) body)])]{

Defines a new class named @racket[class-name] with fields
@racket[field-name]s and methods @racket[method-name]s.
The class has one additional method for each field name
@racket[field-name], which access the field values.

A method is defined with @racket[(define (method-name variable ...)
body)].  Such a definition extends the set of messages every instance
of @racket[class-name] understands.  When an object is sent a
@racket[method-name] message and some values, the @racket[body] of the
method definition is evaluated with the values of the arguments in
place of the @racket[variable]s.  Within a method, @racket[this]
refers to the current object, i.e. the object whose method was called.
Every class implicitly defines an @emph{accessor methods} for each field,
so @racket[(send this field-name)] refers to the value of the field
named @racket[field-name] of @racket[this].

A @racket[test] can be any form of @racket[check-expect].
Conceptually, each @racket[test] is lifted out of the class definition
and does not exist inside any instance of @racket[class-name],
therefore @racket[test]s cannot reference @racket[this].}

@defform[(new class-name expression ...)]{ 

Constructs an object that is an instance of @racket[class-name] and
whose fields are the values of each @racket[expression].  The number
of @racket[expressions] must be equal to the number of fields in
@racket[class-name]'s definition.}

@defform[(send object method-name expression ...)]{ 

Sends @racket[object] the message @racket[method-name] with the values
of the @racket[expression]s as arguments, that is, call
@racket[object]'s method named @racket[method-name] with the given
arguments.}

@defform[(define (method-name variable ...) body)]{
Within a class definition, this form defines a method.
When a method is invoked, occurrences of @racket[this]
within @racket[body] are bound to the receiver object.

Outside of a class definition, this form defines a function;
it is equivalent to @|define-id| in ISL/Î».}

See @racket[define-class].  This form is not allowed outside of a
method definition.

@defform[(fields id ...)]{
See @racket[define-class].  This form is not allowed outside of a
class definition.
