@section{New language features}

@subsection{Interface intheritance}

Interfaces can now inherit from other interfaces.  In this example,
the @r[foo%] class promises to implement the methods specified in
@r[bar<%>], but also the methods listed in the super-interfaces
@r[baz<%>] and @r[foo<%>].

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketmod
  class/1
  (define-interface baz<%> (blah))
  (define-interface foo<%> (blah))
  (define-interface bar<%> 
    (super foo<%>)
    (super baz<%>)
    (x y))

  (define-class foo%
    (implements bar<%>)
    (fields x y z blah))
)


@subsection{Dot notation}

To make programming with objects more convenient, we've added new
syntax to @racketmodname[class/1] to support method calls.  In
particular, the following now sends method @r[x] to object @r[o] with
argument @r[arg]:

@racketblock[
(x #,(racketidfont ".") o arg)
]

This is equivalent to
@racketblock[
(send x o arg)
]

We can chain method calls like this:

@racketblock[
(x #,(racketidfont ".") o arg #,(racketidfont ".") m arg*)
]

This sends the @r[m] method to the @emph{result} of the previous
expression.  
This is equivalent to
@racketblock[
(send (send x o arg) m arg*)
]

Although in lecture this didn't work in the interactions window, it
now works everywhere that you use @racketmodname[class/1]. 


@section{Constructor design issue in modulo zombie (Assignment 3,
Problem 3)}

Course staff solution for regular zombie game:

@filebox[@r[world%]]{
@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
 (define/public (teleport)
   (new world%
	(new player%
	     (random WIDTH)
	     (random HEIGHT))
	(field zombies)
	(field mouse)))
)
}

This has a significant bug: it always produces a plain
@racket[player%], not a @racket[modulo-player%].

Bug (pair0MN):

@filebox[@r[modulo-player%]]{
@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
 (define/public (teleport)
   (new player%
	(* -1 (random WORLD-SIZE))
	(* -1 (random WORLD-SIZE))))
)
}

This has a similar bug: it always produces a plain
@racket[player%], not a @racket[modulo-player%].  However, it's in the
the @tt{modulo-player%} file, so there's an easy fix.  


Lack of abstraction (pair0PQ):

@filebox[@r[modulo-player%]]{
@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
 ;; warp : Real Real -> ModuloPlayer
 ;; change the location of this player to the given location
 (define/public (warp x y)
   (new modulo-player%
	(field dest-x)
	(field dest-y)
	x y))
)
}

@filebox[@r[player%]]{
@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
 ;; warp : Real Real -> Player
 ;; change the location of this player to the given location
 (define/public (warp x y)
   (new player%
	(field dest-x)
	(field dest-y)
	x y))
)
}

This works correctly (this is the fix for the bug in Pair0MN's
solution), but it duplicates code.  

We want to fix these bugs without duplicating code.  

Possible solutions (suggested in class):
@itemlist[
@item{Parameterize the @racket[teleport] method with a class name.
Unfortunately, this doesn't work because the class name in
@racket[new] is not an expression.}
@item{Use @racket[this] as the class name.  This doesn't work because
@racket[this] is an @emph{instance}, not a @emph{class}.}
]

The solution is to add a new method to the interface, which constructs
a new method of the appropriate class.  So, we add this method to the
@racket[player%] class:

@racketblock[
(define/public (move x y)
  (new player% x y))
]

And this method to the @racket[modulo-player%] class:

@racketblock[
(define/public (move x y)
  (new modulo-player% x y))
]

Here's an example of the technique in full.  We start with these classes:

@codeblock{
#lang class/1
(define-class s%
  (fields x y))

;; A Foo is one of:
;; - (new c% Number Number)
;; - (new d% Number Number)

(define-class c%
  (super s%)
  (define/public (make x y) (new c% x y))
  (define/public (origin) (new c% 0 0)))
(define-class d%
  (super s%)
  (define/public (make x y) (new d% x y))
  (define/public (origin) (new d% 0 0)))
}


Now we abstract the @racket[origin] method to use @racket[make], and
we can abstract @racket[origin] to the superclass @racket[s%], since
it becomes identical in both classes, avoiding the code duplication.

@codeblock{
#lang class/1
(define-class s%
  (fields x y)
  (send this make 0 0))

;; A Foo is one of:
;; - (new c% Number Number)
;; - (new d% Number Number)

(define-class c%
  (super s%)
  (define/public (make x y)
    (new c% x y)))
(define-class d%
  (super s%)
  (define/public (make x y) 
    (new d% x y)))

(new c% 50 100)
(send (new c% 50 100) origin)
}



@section{Abstracting list methods with different representations}

Here is the list interface from the last homework assignment:

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
; ==========================================================
; Parametric lists

; A [Listof X] implements list<%>.
(define-interface list<%>
  [; X -> [Listof X]
   ; Add the given element to the front of the list.
   cons
   ; -> [Listof X]
   ; Produce the empty list.
   empty
   ; -> Nat
   ; Count the number of elements in this list.
   length
   ; [Listof X] -> [Listof X]
   ; Append the given list to the end of this list.
   append
   ; -> [Listof X]
   ; Reverse the order of elements in this list.
   reverse
   ; [X -> Y] -> [Listof Y]
   ; Construct the list of results of applying the function
   ; to elements of this list.
   map
   ; [X -> Boolean] -> [Listof X]
   ; Construct the list of elements in this list that
   ; satisfy the predicate.
   filter
   ; [X Y -> Y] Y -> Y
   ; For elements x_0...x_n, (f x_0 ... (f x_n b)).
   foldr
   ; [X Y -> Y] Y -> Y
   ; For elements x_0...x_n, (f x_n ... (f x_0 b)).
   foldl])
)

Here's the usual implementation of a small subset of this interface,
first for the recursive union implementation:

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
  (define-class cons%
    (fields first rest)
    
    (define/public (cons x)
      (new cons% x this))
    
    (define/public (empty)
      (new empty%))

    (define/public (length)
      (add1 (send (field rest) length)))

    (define/public (foldr c b)
      (c (field first)
	 (send (field rest) foldr c b))))

  (define-class empty%
    
    (define/public (cons x)
      (new cons% x this))
    
    (define/public (empty)
      this)

    (define/public (length)
      0)

    (define/public (foldr c b)
      b)))

And for the wrapper list implementation:

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
  (define-class wlist%
    (fields ls)
    
    (define/public (cons x)
      (new wlist% (ls:cons x (field ls))))
    
    (define/public (empty)
      (new wlist% ls:empty))

    (define/public (length)
      (ls:length (field ls)))

    (define/public (foldr c b)
      (ls:foldr c b (field ls))))
)

None of these look the same, so how can we abstract?  Our abstraction
design recipe for using inheritance requires that methods look
identical in order to abstract them into a common super class.  But,
for example, the @r[length] method looks like this for @r[wlist%]:

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
    (define/public (length)
      (ls:length (field ls))))

Like this for @r[empty%]:

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
    (define/public (length)
      0))

And like this for @r[cons%]:

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
    (define/public (length)
      (add1 (send (field rest) length))))


@margin-note{In fact, all of
		them---but
		that's a topic
		for another day.}
Before we can abstract this method, we must make them all look the
same. Fortunately, many list operations
can be expressed using just a few simple operations, of which the most
important is @r[foldr].  Here's an implementation of @r[length] which
just uses @r[foldr] and simple arithmetic.  

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
    (define/public (length)
      (send this foldr (λ (a b) (add1 b)) 0))
)

Note that this isn't specific to any one implementation of lists---in
fact, we can use it for any of them.  This means that we can now
abstract the method, creating a new @r[list%] class to share all of
our common code:


@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
 (define-class list%
    (define/public (length)
      (send this foldr (λ (a b) (add1 b)) 0))
    (code:comment "other methods here"))
)

The only methods that need to be implemented differently for different
list versions are @r[empty] and @r[cons], because they construct new
lists, and @r[foldr], because it's the fundamental operation we use to
build the other operations out of.  It's also helpful to implementat
@r[foldl], since it's fairly complex to factor out.  

@section{Solidifying what we've done}

So far in this class, we've seen a number of different ways of
specifying the creation and behavior of the data we work with.  At
this point, it's valuable to take a step back and consider all of the
concepts we've seen, and how they differ from what we had in Fundies
1. 

@subsection{Data Definitions}

Data defintions describe how data is constructed.  For example,
primitive classes of data such as @tt{Number} and @tt{String} are
examples, of data defintions, as is @r[(make-posn Number Number)].  We
can also describe enumerations and unions, just as we did previously.  

In this class, we've introduced a new way of writing data defintions,
referring to @emph{classes}.  For example:

@racketblock[
(code:comment "A [WList X] is (new wlist% [Listof X])")
]

We can combine this style of data defintion with other data definition
forms, such as unions.  However, classes also need to describe one
other important aspect---their @emph{interface}.  So we will add the
following to the above data defintion:

@racketblock[
(code:comment "A [WList X] is (new wlist% [Listof X])")
(code:comment "    and implements the [IList X] interface")
]

@subsection{Interface Definitions}

An @emph{interface defintion} lists the operations that something that
implements the interface will support.  Just as we have a convention that data
defintions start with a capital letter, interface defintions start with a
capital letter "I".  The interface defintion for @tt{[IList X]} is:

@codeblock[#:keep-lang-line? #f]{
#lang racket
;; An [IList X] implements

;; empty : -> [IList X]
;; Produce an empty list
;; cons : X -> [IList X]
;; Produce a list with the given element at the front.
;; empty? : -> Boolean
;; Determine if this list is empty.
;; length : -> Number
;; Count the elements in this list

;; ... and other methods ...
}

There are several important aspects of this interface defintion to note.
First, it lists all of the methods that can be used on an @tt{[IList X]}, along
with their contracts and purpose statements.  Mere method names are not
enough---with just a method name you have no idea how to use a method, or what
to use it for.  Second, interface defintions can have parameters (here @tt{X}),
just like data defintions.  Third, there is no description of how to
@emph{construct} an @tt{[IList X]}.  That's the job of data defintions that
implement this interface.  

Of course, just like data defintions don't have to be named, interface
defintions don't have to be named either.  If you need to describe an interface
just once, it's fine to write the interface right there where you need it.  

@subsection{Contracts}

Contracts describe the appropriate inputs and outputs of functions and
methods.  In the past, we've seen many contracts that refer to data
defintions.  In this class, we've also seen contracts that refer to interface
defintions, like so:

@racketblock[(code:comment "[IList Number] -> [IList Number]")]

When describing the contract of a function or method, it's almost always
preferable to refer to an interface definition instead of a data defintion that
commits to a specific representation.  @; Sometimes, there's only one data
@; definition that makes sense, and then there isn't a difference between using
@; the interface defintion and the data defintion.  

@subsection{Design Recipe}

Interfaces change the design recipe in one important way.  In the Template
step, we take an inventory of what is available in the body of a function or
method.  When designing a method, we have the following available to us:
@itemlist[
@item{The fields of this object, accessed with @r[field],}
@item{The methods of this object, accessed by calling them,}
@item{And the operations of the arguments, which are given by their @emph{interfaces}.}
]

For example, if a method takes an input @r[a-list] which is specified in the
contract to be an @tt{IList}, then we know that @r[(send a-list empty?)],
@r[(send a-list length)], and so on.  


@section{Delegation}

So far, we've seen multiple ways to abstract repeated code.  First, in Fundies
1, we saw functional abstraction, where we take parts of functions that differ
and make them parameters to the abstracted function.  Second, in this class
we've seen abstraction  by using inheritance, where if methods in two related
classes are identical, they can be lifted into one method in a common
superclass.  

However, can we still abstract common code without @emph{either} of these
mechanisms?  Yes.  

Consider the @racketmodname[class/0], @emph{without} helper functions.  We can
write a binary tree class like this:

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketmod
  class/0
  ;; A BT is one of:
  ;; - (new leaf% Number)
  ;; - (new node% Number BT BT)

  ;; double : Number -> BT
  ;; Double this tree and put the number on top.

  (define-class leaf%
    (fields number)
    
    (define/public (double n)
      (new node% n this this)))

  (define-class node%
    (fields number left right)
    
    (define/public (double n)
      (new node% n this this)))
)

Unfortunately, the @r[double] method is identical in both the @r[leaf%] and
@r[node%] classes.  How can we abstract this without using inheritance or a
helper function?

One solution is to create a new class, and @emph{delegate} the responsibility
of doing the doubling to it.  Below is an example of this:

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
  (define-class helper%
    ;; Number BT -> BT
    ;; Double the given tree and puts the number on top.
    (define/public (double-helper number bt)
      (new node% number bt bt)))
  (define tutor (new helper%))

  (define-class leaf%
    (fields number)
    
    (define/public (double n)
      (send tutor double-helper n this)))

  (define-class node%
    (fields number left right)
    
    (define/public (double n)
      (send tutor double-helper n this)))
)

The @r[helper%] class has just one method, although we could add as many as we
wanted.  We also need only one instance of @r[helper%], called @r[tutor],
although we could create new instances when we needed them as well.  Now the
body of @r[double-helper] contains all of the doubling logic in our program,
which might become much larger without needing duplicate code.
