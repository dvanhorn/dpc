@section{A look at the Universe API}

Today we're going to start looking at the design of multiple,
concurrently running programs that communicate we each other.  We will
use the @racket[universe] system as our library for communicating
programs.

The basic universe concept is that there is a "universe" program that
is the adminstrator of a set of world programs.  The universe and the
world programs can communicate with each other by sending messages,
which are represented as S-Expressions.

So far we have focused on the design of single programs; we are now
going to start looking at the design of communicating systems of
programs.

In addition to these notes, be sure to read the documentation on
@secref[#:doc '(lib "teachpack/teachpack.scrbl") #:tag-prefixes
'("2htdp") "world2"].

@section{Messages}

A message is represented as an S-Expression.  Here is there is their
data definition:

An S-expression is roughly a nested list of basic data; to be precise
an S-expression is one of:

@itemlist[
 @item{a string,}
 @item{a symbol,}
 @item{a number,}
 @item{a boolean,}
 @item{a char, or}
 @item{a list of S-expressions.}]

The way that a world program sends a message to the universe is by
constructing a package:

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
  ;; A Package is a (make-package World SExp).
)

The world component is the new world just like the event handler's
produced for single world programs.  The s-expression component is a
message that is sent to the universe.

@section[#:tag "counter"]{Simple universe example}

As a simple example, let's look at a world program that counts up and
sends messages to a universe server as it counts.  In this simple
example there is only one world that communicates with the server, and
the server does nothing but receive the count message (it sends no
messages back to the world).

Let's start with the counting world program:

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketmod
  class/1
  (require class/universe)
  (require 2htdp/image)
  
  (define-class counter-world%
    (fields n)
  
    (define/public (on-tick)
      (new counter-world% (add1 (field n))))
  
    (define/public (tick-rate)
      1)
  
    (define/public (to-draw)
      (overlay (text (number->string (field n))
                     40
                     "red")
               (empty-scene 300 100))))
  
  (big-bang (new counter-world% 0))
)

When you run this program, you see the world counting up from zero.

Now to register this program with a universe server, we need to
implement a @racket[register] method that produces a string that is
the IP address of the server.  (Since we're going to run the universe
and world on the same computer, we will use @racket[LOCALHOST] which
is bound to the address of our computer.)

@filebox[@r[world%]]{
@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
  (define/public (register) LOCALHOST)
)
}

Now when you run this program you will see the world program try to
connect to the universe, but since we have not written---much less
run---the server, it cannot find the universe.  After a few tries, it
gives up and continues running without communicating with the
universe.

Now let's write a seperate simple universe server.  To do this, you
want to open a new tab or window.


A universe program, much like a world program, consists of a current
state of the universe and is event-driven, invoking methods to produce
new universe states.

We'll be working with the OO-style universe, but you should read the
documentation for @racketmodname[2htdp/universe] and translate over
the concepts to our setting as you've done for @racket[big-bang].

At a minimum, the universe must handle the events of:

@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
  @item{a world
registering with this universe, and }
  @item{a registered world sending a
message to the universe.}]

The first is handled by the @racket[on-new] method and the second by
the @racket[on-msg]:

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketmod
  class/1
  (require class/universe)

  (define-class universe%
    ;; IWorld -> Bundle
    (define/public (on-new iw) ...)
  
    ;; IWorld S-Expr -> Bundle
    (define/public (on-msg iw m) ...))
)

When a world registers, the @racket[on-new] method is called with an
IWorld value.  An IWorld value opaquely represents a world, that is
you do not have the ability to examine the contents of the value, but
you can compare it for equality with other IWorld values using
@racket[iworld=?].

When a world sends message, the @racket[on-msg] method is called with
the IWorld representing the world that sent the message and the S-Exp
message that was sent.

In both cases, the method must produce a bundle:

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
  ;; A Bundle is a (make-bundle Universe [Listof Mail] [Listof IWorld]).
)

The universe component is the new state of the universe; the list of
mail is a list of messages that will be sent back to the worlds (more
on this in a moment), and the list of worlds are worlds that the
server has chosen to disconnect from.


For the purposes of our example, the universe maintains no state (the
class has no data).  When a new world registers, we do nothing, and
when a world sends a message, we also do nothing, send nothing in
response, and disconnect no worlds:

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketmod 
  class/1
  (require class/universe)

  (define-class universe%
    ;; IWorld -> Bundle
    (define/public (on-new iw) 
      (make-bundle this empty empty))
    
    ;; IWorld S-Expr -> Bundle
    (define/public (on-msg iw m)
      (make-bundle this empty empty)))
  
  (universe (new universe%)) 
) 

Running this program launches the universe server, making it ready to
receive registrations from worlds.  After starting the universe
server, if we switch back to the world program tab and run it, we'll
see that it successfully registers with the universe and the universe
console reports that the world signed up with it.

Thrilling.

At this point, the world registers, but never sends any message to the
server.  Now let's modify the world program to notify the server when
it ticks by sending it's current count as a message.

That requires changing our on-tick method from:

@filebox[@r[world%]]{
@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
  (define/public (on-tick)
    (new counter-world% (add1 (field n))))
)
}

to one that constructs a package:

@filebox[@r[world%]]{
@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
  (define/public (on-tick)
    (make-package (new counter-world% (add1 (field n)))
		  (add1 (field n))))
)
}

Now let's re-run the world program.  Notice that messages are being
received by the server in the console.

@section{Migrating computation from client to server}

Now let's change the system so that "work" of adding is done on the
server side.  When the world ticks it sends its current count to the
server; when the server receives the count, it responds by sending a
message back to the world that is the count plus one.  On the world
side, that means we must now add the ability to receive messages by
implementing the @racket[on-receive] method, which will update the
world state appropriately and the @racket[on-tick] method will do no
computation, but only communication:

@filebox[@r[world%]]{
@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
  (define/public (on-tick)
    (make-package this (field n)))
  
  (define/public (on-receive m)
    (new counter-world% m))
)
}

On the server side, we now need to send a message back to the world,
so we need to consider the data definition for mail:

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
  ;; A Mail is a (make-mail IWorld S-Exp).
)

This constructs a message that will be sent to the world represented
by the IWorld value consisting of the S-Exp value.

@filebox[@r[universe%]]{
@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
  (define/public (on-msg iw m)
    (make-bundle this 
		 (list (make-mail iw (add1 m))) 
		 empty))
)
}

If we restart the universe and world, you'll notice that the universe
console is now showing messages going in both directions.

Now let's see an example of multiple world programs communicating with
a single server.

If we were to just write this:

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
  (big-bang (new counter-world% 0))
  (big-bang (new counter-world% 50))
)

the program would wait for the first big-bang expression to finish
evaluating before moving on the second one.  To make it possible to
run many worlds at the same time, the universe library provides the
@racket[launch-many-worlds] form that will evaluate all of its
subexpressions in parallel:

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
  (launch-many-worlds
    (big-bang (new counter-world% 0))
    (big-bang (new counter-world% 50)))
)

Notice that both worlds count independently.

@section{Guess my number}

Now let's a more interesting game.  We'll start by considering the
guess my number game.

In this game, the server is thinking of a number and you have to guess
it.

Here's the server:

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketmod
  class/1
  (require class/universe)

  (define-class universe%
    (fields the-number)
    
    (define/public (on-new iw) 
      (make-bundle this empty empty))
    
    (define/public (on-msg iw m)
      (make-bundle this 
		   (list (make-mail iw (respond m (field the-number))))
		   empty)))

  ;; Number Number -> String
  (define (respond guess number)
    (cond [(< guess number) "too small"]
	  [(> guess number) "too big"]
	  [else "just right"]))

  ;; the universe is thinking of 2.
  (universe (new universe% 2))
)


The universe now has a single peice of data, which is the number it is
thinking of.  It responds to guesses by sending back a string
indicating whether the guess is just right, too big, or too small.

Here is the client:

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketmod
  class/1
  (require class/universe)
  (require 2htdp/image)

  (define-class guess-world%
    (fields status)
    
    (define/public (on-receive m)
      (new guess-world% m))
      
    (define/public (to-draw)
      (overlay (text (field status)
		     40
		     "red")
	       (empty-scene 300 100)))
    
    (define/public (on-key k)
      (local [(define n (string->number k))]
        (if (number? n)
	    (make-package this n)
	    this)))                    
  
    (define/public (register) LOCALHOST))

  (big-bang (new guess-world% "guess a number"))
)

The client has a single peice of data, which represents the status of
its guess.  It responds to numeric key events by sending the guess to
the server and ignores all other key events.

The @racket[string->number] function is being used to test for numeric
key events---it works by producing @racket[false] when given a string
that cannot be converted to a number, otherwise it converts the string
to a number.

@section{Two player guess my number}

Now let's write a 2-player version of the game where one player thinks
of a number and the other player guesses.

Here is the server:

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketmod
  class/1
  (require class/universe)

  ;; A Universe is a (new universe% [U #f Number] [U #f IWorld] [U #f IWorld]).
  (define-class universe%
    (fields number
	    picker
	    guesser)
    
    ;; is the given world the picker?
    (define/public (picker? iw)
      (and (iworld? (field picker))
	   (iworld=? iw (field picker))))
    
    ;; is the given world the guesser?
    (define/public (guesser? iw)
      (and (iworld? (field guesser))
	   (iworld=? iw (field guesser))))
    
    (define/public (on-new iw)
      (cond [(false? (field picker))
	     (make-bundle
	      (new universe% false iw false)
	      (list (make-mail iw "pick a number"))
	      empty)]          
	    [(false? (field guesser))
	     (make-bundle
	      (new universe% (field number) (field picker) iw)
	      empty
	      empty)]          
	    [else
	     (make-bundle this empty (list iw))]))
    
    (define/public (on-msg iw m)
      (cond [(and (picker? iw)
		  (false? (field number)))           
	     (make-bundle
	      (new universe% m (field picker) (field guesser))
	      empty
	      empty)]
	    [(picker? iw) ;; already picked a number
	     (make-bundle this empty empty)]
	    [(and (guesser? iw)
		  (number? (field number)))
	     (make-bundle this 
			  (list (make-mail iw (respond m (field number))))
			  empty)]
	    [(guesser? iw)
	     (make-bundle this
			  (list (make-mail iw "no number"))
			  empty)])))
  
  ;; Number Number -> String
  (define (respond guess number)
    (cond [(< guess number) "too small"]
	  [(> guess number) "too big"]
	  [else "just right"]))

  (universe (new universe% false false false))
)

The client stays the same!  You can launch the two players with:

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
  (launch-many-worlds
   (big-bang (new guess-world% "guess a number"))
   (big-bang (new guess-world% "guess a number"))))
