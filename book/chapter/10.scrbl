Is the test really on the 22nd? -- yes.

Inheritance and overriding

  Why do we use inheritance?
    1. Abstracting common code
    2. Managing the type system (in other languages)
    3. Extend existing system -- often overused, but very useful

  Example: points
    color-point% extends point%
      Use overriding to implement mv correctly for color-point%
    color-point% contains point%
      1. Class relationships aren't explicit
      2. Must manually delegate every inherited behavior

  Use mutation?
  Use update methods?
  Use copying + mutation?
    Performance analysis is hard and is best done empirically

  Dispatch
    Call the method most specific to the _object_
    e.g. double-move calls mv which dispatches to the appropriate method body

  Example: worlds
    big-bang expects many behaviors that we usually don't want to specify

  super to dispatch one level up
    Jumping >1 level would very often be a bad idea and break modularity

  With inheritance, data definitions are always _open_
    e.g. A Point is one of
          - (point% Num Num)
          - (color-point% Color Num Num)
          - ...

  Overriding lets you parametrize behavior of methods by supplying new behavior
    Powerful, just like higher-order functions in FP
    But power comes with responsibility: must respect behavioral subtyping!

Overriding in Java:

@verbatim|{
class Point {
    Integer x;
    Integer y;

    public Point(Integer x, Integer y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public Point mv(Integer dx, Integer dy) {
        return new Point(this.x + dx, this.y + dy);
    }

    public Point double_move(Integer dxy) {
        return this.mv(dxy,dxy);
    }

}

class CPoint extends Point {
    String color;
    
    public CPoint(String color, Integer x, Integer y) {
        super(x,y);
        this.color = color;
    }

    public CPoint mv(Integer dx, Integer dy) {
        return new CPoint(this.color, this.x-dx, this.y-dy);
    }
    
}
